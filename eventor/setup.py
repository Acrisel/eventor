NAME is usually similar to or the same as your PACKAGE name but can be whatever you want. 
The NAME is what people will refer to your software as, the name under which your 
software is listed in PyPI and—more importantly—under which users will install it 
(for example, pip install NAME).

DESCRIPTION is just a short description of your project. A sentence will suffice.
