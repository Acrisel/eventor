Thanks for downloading across.

To install it, make sure you have Python 3.2 or greater installed. Then run
this command from the command prompt:

    python setup.py install

If you're upgrading from a previous version, you need to remove it first.

AS AN ALTERNATIVE, you can just copy the entire “acres” directory to Python's
site-packages directory, which is located wherever your Python installation
lives. Some places you might check are:

    /usr/lib/python3.4/site-packages (Unix, Python 2.4)
    C:\\PYTHON\site-packages         (Windows)
